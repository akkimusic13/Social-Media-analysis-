SOCIAL MEDIA â€“ STACK OVERFLOW

Tool Used: 

I have opted to complete the project with HIVE using cloud lab.

Process followed:

1.) Downloaded the answers csv file and edited it according to distinguish the tags column with collection delimiter ":".

Then uploaded the same to cloud lab HDFS using the techniques learned during session. In this case through upload link in file browser.

2.) Used my existing database "desh" to create table for the file uploaded in hdfs.

3.) Created table with below script:

      create table socialmediaIntelligence(recordno int,qid int,questionaire_uid int,scores_question int,time_of_question bigint,tags array<string>,noofviews int,noofanswers int,uniqueanswerid int,userid_of_answerer int,answer_score int,time_of_answer bigint)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by ','
collection items terminated by '\:';

4.) Loaded the data in the table from HDFS path as:

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/ff94ed73875dca0944a2a34e7a2810/answers11.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE socialmediaIntelligence;

5.) Created Query for top 10 most commonly used tags as:

select tags, count(*) as countoftags  from socialmediaIntelligence group by tags order by countoftags desc limit 10;

6.) Created Query to find average time to answer question as:

Select averagetime as TimeInSeconds, round(averagetime /3600,1) as ApproxTimeInHours from

(

Select cast(avg(time_of_answer - time_of_question) as BIGINT) as averagetime from socialmediaIntelligence 

) avg;

7.) Created Query to find number of questions which got answered within 1 hour as:


select count(distinct qid) as noofquestions from socialmediaIntelligence  where (time_of_answer - time_of_question)<3600;

8.) Created Query to find tags of questions which got answered within 1 hour as:


select distinct tags as tagsofquestion from socialmediaIntelligence where (time_of_answer - time_of_question)<3600;
